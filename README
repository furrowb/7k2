Running
-------

As the game data and music have not been released under the GPL, you need to
install the original game first (either from CD or a digital distribution
service). The game data also needs to be patched to version 1.20, if not
already. Then, convert all the game data files to lowercase. Finally, copy the
7k2 exe to the game data directory and run it from there.


Game music
----------

Playing from the CD is no longer supported, so you will need to extract the
audio tracks and copy them to the music directory. The tracks need to be
renamed as follows:

Track -> Name
  01  -> cbrief.wav
  02  -> cfrywin.wav
  03  -> menu.wav
  04  -> lose.wav
  05  -> win.wav
  06  -> bkmusic1.wav
  07  -> bkmusic2.wav
  08  -> bkmusic3.wav
  09  -> bkmusic4.wav
  10  -> bkmusic5.wav
  11  -> bkmusic6.wav
  12  -> bkmusic7.wav
