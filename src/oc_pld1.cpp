/*
You have a strong military presence in the scenario. Unforturnately,
you don't have the sufficient economic facilites to provide you with
the income to pay the upkeep costs of the military force. Now the
enemy has embarked an invasion against you and they are coming. The
loyalty of your generals and soldiers continue to drop as you fail
to pay them salaries. (Solution to this: there are ample natural
resources at the southern part of the map. You must mine them to
increase your revenue. At the same time shut down some of the
existing buildings to save costs.) The objective is to completely
fend off the invading force
